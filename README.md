## Overview :
1. Analyzed top travel destinations across India using data visualization and statistical analysis.
2. Explored key trends in Google ratings, number of reviews, entrance fees, and popularity.
3. Aimed to generate actionable insights to assist travelers and tourism stakeholders.

## Insights :
1. Most highly-rated destinations also have higher review counts, indicating both quality and popularity.
2. Several low-cost destinations offer excellent experiences (high ratings at low entrance fees).
3. Tourist interest tends to cluster around heritage sites and natural attractions.
4. Some destinations with high entrance fees do not necessarily offer better-rated experiences.

## Recommendation :
1. Travelers can prioritize destinations that offer a high rating-to-cost ratio for maximum value.
2. Tourism boards should focus on promoting lesser-known, highly-rated, low-cost destinations to distribute tourist traffic.
3. Continuous monitoring of visitor reviews and feedback can help maintain quality and improve experiences.
4. Dynamic pricing strategies could be explored for high-traffic destinations to manage crowding while enhancing revenue.
